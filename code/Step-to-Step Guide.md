# Step-by-Step Guide to Build the Pizza Mania App

## 1. Setting Up
1. Go to MIT App Inventor.
2. Create a new project and name it "Pizza Mania."

## 2. Designing the User Interface
1. Drag and drop the following components onto Screen1:
   - **Checkboxes**: Add one for each menu item.
   - **Label**: To display the total amount.
   - **Buttons**: Two buttons named "Make Your Bill" and "Modify Your Bill."
2. Arrange components in a visually appealing layout.

## 3. Adding Logic in Blocks
1. Initialize a global variable `TA` (Total Amount) to 0.
2. For each checkbox, add a block to increase/decrease `TA` based on whether the checkbox is selected or deselected.
3. Link the "Make Your Bill" button to display `TA` in a label.
4. Configure the "Modify Your Bill" button to reset `TA` to 0 and clear the checkboxes.

## 4. Testing the App
1. Connect a test device to Kodular.
2. Use the "Test" feature to ensure the app behaves as expected:
   - Checkbox selection updates the total.
   - Reset button clears the total and checkboxes.

## 5. Exporting the APK
1. Once tested, build the APK by selecting "Export" from the menu.
2. Install the APK on your Android device to deploy the app.

## 6. Customization (Optional)
- Update menu items or prices in the blocks.
- Change the UI theme to suit your brand.

## 7. Deployment
1. Share the APK file with users or upload it to an app store.
2. Collect feedback for further improvements.
